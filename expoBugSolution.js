The solution involves carefully managing the Android Gradle Plugin version. First, ensure that your project's `gradle.properties` file (located in the android folder of your project) explicitly defines the AGP version.  If using a version explicitly defined by Expo, check if the version is the latest. Using a compatible but slightly older version might help. Second, check your Android SDK Manager to verify that you have the necessary build tools and components installed, which includes the correct version of the Android Gradle Plugin.  You should clean and rebuild the project. Lastly, consider upgrading Expo CLI itself and run `expo prebuild` before attempting to build again.
